# Singly Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at the contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers.    
In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.   
## Challenge
how to move from one node to another and make pointer refer to next node and make head refer to the first node.    
## Approach & Efficiency
Bigo(1) for time and space    
## API
insert method it will insert node to the linked list  from the end   
Inclued method it will check if the node exist in the LinkedList or not
