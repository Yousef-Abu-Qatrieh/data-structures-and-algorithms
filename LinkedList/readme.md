# Singly Linked List
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at the contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers.    
In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.
## Challenge
how to move from one node to another and make pointer refer to next node and make head refer to the first node.
## Approach & Efficiency
Bigo(1) for time and space
## API
insert method it will insert node to the linked list  from the end   

Include method it will check if the node exist in the LinkedList or not   
append method it will add node at the end of linked list  
InsertBefore method will add node before specific node   
InsetAfter method will add node after specific node
## zippylinkedlist
method that will merge 2 linked list

## kthFromEnd
method that will return the node index if the key are the same if key not the same it will give an exception
