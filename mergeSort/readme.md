# MergeSort   

Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves.

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO for space O(n) and for time O(n*log n)
