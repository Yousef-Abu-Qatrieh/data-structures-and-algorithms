# Stacks and Queues
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
## FILO
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

## LIFO
Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.    
Queues follow these concepts:
# Equeue
A queue is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the queue, but does not reference its previous.
## FIFO
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

## LILO
Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

## Challenge for stack
Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to
## Challenge for queue
Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.  
Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

## Approach & Efficiency
big o(1)
## API
1- push it will add node at the top stack  
2- isEmpty check if stack or not   
3- pop remove node from the top stack   
4-peek return last node in the top without remove it   
5-enqueue add node to the queue    
6-peek return last node in the top without remove it   
7-dequeue remove node from the front of queue
8- isEmpty check if Queue is empty or not

GetMax that implement Stack to find max Node value in stack

Animal shelter that return dog or cat depend on pref value

time o(n)   
space o(1)  

validateParentheses it will return either true if the Parentheses have start&end  or false if the Parentheses  doesn't have start & end
