# Trees
tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”).    

## Challenge
in binary tree we use Queue to store data inside it  which mean that we use another data structure to enhance our algorithm  
## Approach & Efficiency
In binary search tree the search is Big O log(n) it is more efficient than binary tree which is O(n)
## API
Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.  


Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
